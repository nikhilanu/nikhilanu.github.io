    content: |-
      I’m a London-based Software Engineer who enjoys turning data and product ideas into clear, fast, and maintainable features.
      Recently at HubSpot, I’ve delivered analytics surfaces that improved monitoring and decision-making at scale — from SMS error
      insights across thousands of portals to mobile-optimised click maps. Earlier, at Citigroup I handled multi-TB data migrations and
      built tooling that saved ~$160k/year. I hold an MSc (Distinction) in Advanced Computer Science from The University of Manchester.
